# SslabLU

Explore a novel formulation of domain decomposition using S-maps as opposed to DtN maps,
and efficiently factorize the resulting system using H-matrix techniques.

## Useful utilities
- `fd_disc.py` a very simple finite difference discretization for prototyping
- `PetSc` a powerful and easy to install python library for sparse direct solvers (including mumps). See the associated example usage file.
- `simplebalancedoctree` a tree package available through annayesy github page useful for H-matrix algos.
